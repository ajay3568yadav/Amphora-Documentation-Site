The first step is to access Giles, which is where the Amphora project is located. You will need to have access to Giles to proceed further. 

2. Admin Approval:
Once you are in Dials, an admin (who can be the project manager or another designated person) needs to grant you access to the Giles. 

3. Access to Giles:

5. Request for Access: 
Upon logging into Github, you will be prompted with a message that asks whether you want to grant access to Amphora. You will need to approve this request.
